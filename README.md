# Automatic-Fare-Collection-System-Using-Near-Field-Communication

## Background
Traditional ticketing system for railways involves serpentine queues for passengers and  requires constant human processing. Attempts to fix this problem include coupon books for passengers and more recently smart cards for standard railways.

## Problem Statement
In standard railway, the purpose of the smartcard is to automatically print a ticket for the passenger. However, if a smart card system is to be implemented for Metrorail the purpose of this smartcard will be to give the passenger access to the station by commanding the turnstile to rotate(or a flap gate to open) and then again enable the passenger to exit at the destination station. 

## Solution 
We propose a more advanced automatic ticketing system using **Near Field Communication** keeping in mind the specific needs and requirements of Metrorail systems in India and also the convenience of the passengers. 

##Publication
The prototype of this system is implemented and described in this **[paper](http://www.ijerd.com/paper/vol10-issue4/Version_2/C1042024.pdf)**.
